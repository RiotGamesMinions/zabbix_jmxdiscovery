# Contributing

We accept both issues and pull requests via Github. Pull requests should have a
clear summary explaining the change and why you think it's cool.

## Coding style

The first rule of our project is to conform to whatever current standards you
see in the code around you. Past that, we only have a few codified rules:

  - Use markdown for plain text.
  - Spaces not tabs.
  - Indents should be 4 spaces.

## Areas For Contribution

Though we're happy to receive any pull request, we're actively looking for
contributions on the following issues:

  - Example Zabbix templates using jmx_discovery.
  - Improvements to documentation.
