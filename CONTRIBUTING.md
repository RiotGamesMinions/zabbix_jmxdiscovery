# Contributing
We accept both issues and pull requests via Github. Pull requests should have a
clear summary explaining the change and why you think it's cool.

## Coding style
The first rule of our project is to conform to whatever current standards you
see in the code around you. Past that, we only have a few codified rules:

 * Use markdown for plain text.
 * Spaces not tabs.
 * Indents should be 4 spaces.

## Areas For Contribution

Though we're happy to receive any pull request, we're actively looking for
contributions on the following issues:

 * Example Zabbix templates.
 * Improvements to documentation.
 * Regex exclusion of certain MBeans
